DSP Examples
================
This example demonstrates how to use the Hailo DSP to perform image preprocessing operations. The pipeline consists of three main operations:

1. Crop and Resize with Letterbox:
   - Takes a raw RGB input image
   - Crops the top-left quarter (from (0,0) to (input_width/2, input_height/2))
   - Resizes to 640Ã—640 pixels with letterboxing to maintain aspect ratio

2. Format Conversion:
   - Converts the RGB image to NV12 format

3. Affine Rotation:
   - Takes the NV12 image
   - Applies a 30-degree rotation

The example shows how to chain multiple DSP operations together to create a complete image processing pipeline, from raw RGB input to rotated NV12 output.

Requirements
------------

- Hailo15h 
- CMake >= 3.16


Usage
-----
0. Make sure you have installed all of the requirements.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone <https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples.git>
        
    cd Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/runtime/hailo-15/dsp_example
    ``` 

2. Download the raw image and copy it to the hailo15:
    ```shell script
    ./download_resources.sh
    scp bus.raw root@10.0.0.1:/home/root
    ```  

3. Source the sdk enviorment
    ```shell script
    source <PATH_TO_SDK>/environment-setup-armv8a-poky-linux
    ```

4. Compile the project on the development machine  
	```shell script
    ./build.sh
    ```
	This creates the directory hierarchy build/x86_64 and compile an executable file called dsp_example

5. Copy the example to the hailo15
	```shell script
    scp ./build/x86_64/dsp_example root@10.0.0.1:/home/root
    ```

6. Run the example on the Hailo15:

	```shell script
    ./dsp_example --input-width 810 --input-height 1080 --output-width 640 --output-height 640 bus.raw
    ```

7. Copy the generated raw images from Hailo15 to your host machine:

    ```bash
    scp root@10.0.0.1:/home/root/cropped_and_resized_image.raw .
    scp root@10.0.0.1:/home/root/affine_rotation_image.raw .
    ```

8. View the generated raw images using the provided conversion script:

    ```bash
    python convert_image.py cropped_and_resized_image.raw --width 640 --height 640 --format rgb
    python convert_image.py affine_rotation_image.raw --width 640 --height 640 --format nv12
    ```

    The script will display the image in a window. Press 'q' to close the window.
    To save the converted image, add the `--save` flag.
	
Arguments
---------

- ``--input-width`` : Width of the input image (in pixels)

- ``--input-height`` : Height of the input image (in pixels)

- ``--output-width`` : Desired width after resize (in pixels)

- ``--output-height`` : Desired height after resize (in pixels)

- ``raw_image_path`` : Path to the raw RGB input image file

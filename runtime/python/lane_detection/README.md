Lane Detection
================

This example demonstrates lane detection using a **Hailo8** or **Hailo10H** device.  
It receives an input video and annotates it with the lane detection coordinates.

Requirements
------------
- hailo_platform:
    - 4.23.0 (for Hailo-8 devices)
    - 5.1.1 (for Hailo-10H devices)
- loguru
- tqdm
- opencv-python



Supported Models
----------------
- ufld_v2_tu

Usage
-----

0. Install PyHailoRT
    - Download the HailoRT whl from the Hailo website - make sure to select the correct Python version. 
    - Install whl:
        ```shell script
        pip install hailort-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXX-linux_x86_64.whl
        ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone <https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples.git>
        
    cd Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/runtime/hailo-8/python/lane_detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```shell script
    ./lane_detection -n <model_path> -i <input_video_path> -o <output_path>
    ```

Arguments
---------

- `-n, --net`: 
    - A **model name** (e.g., `ufld_v2_tu`) → the script will automatically download and resolve the correct HEF for your device.
    - A **file path** to a local HEF → the script will use the specified network directly.
- `-i, --input`:
  - An **input source** such as an image (`bus.jpg`), a video (`video.mp4`), a directory of images, or `camera` to use the system camera.
  - A **predefined input name** from `inputs.json` (e.g., `bus`, `street`).
    - If you choose a predefined name, the input will be **automatically downloaded** if it doesn't already exist.
  - Use `--list-inputs` to display all available predefined inputs.
- ``-o, --output``: Path to save the output video with annotated lanes.
- `--list-nets` Print all supported networks for this application (from `networks.json`) and exit.
- `--list-inputs`: Print the available predefined input resources (videos) defined in `inputs.json` for this application, then exit.

For more information:
```shell script
./lane_detection.py -h
```
Example 
-------

**List supported networks**
```shell script
./lane_detection.py --list-nets
```

**List available input resources**
```shell script
./lane_detection.py --list-inputs
```

**inference**
```shell script
./lane_detection.py -n ./ufld_v2_tu.hef -i input_video.mp4
```

Additional Notes
----------------

- The example was only tested with:
    - 4.23.0 (for Hailo-8 devices)
    - 5.1.1 (for Hailo-10H devices) 
- The postprocessed video will be saved as **output_video.mp4**.  
- The list of supported detection models is defined in `networks.json`.

Oriented Object Detection
=========================
This example demonstrates a YoloV11 OBB based oriented object detection model using a Hailo-8, Hailo-8L, or Hailo-10H device.
It receives a HEF and images/video/camera as input, and returns the image\video with annotations of detected objects and bounding boxes.
Oriented object detection extends traditional bounding box detection by adding rotation angle, making it ideal for:
- Aerial/satellite imagery
- Document analysis
- Rotated text detection
- Any scenario where objects may appear at arbitrary angles

Requirements
------------

- hailo_platform==4.23.0
- loguru
- opencv-python
- scipy
- lap
- cython_bbox
- jq
  ```shell script
  sudo apt-get install jq
  ```

Supported Models
----------------
This example currently supports only YoloV11-OBB model.
 

Usage
-----
To avoid compatibility issues, it's recommended to have a separate venv from the DFC.

0. Install PCIe driver and PyHailoRT
    - Download and install the PCIe driver and PyHailoRT from the Hailo website
    - To install the PyHailoRT whl:
        ```shell script
        pip install hailort-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXX-linux_x86_64.whl
        ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone <https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples.git>
        
    cd Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/runtime/hailo-8/python/oriented_object_detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```shell script
    ./oriented_object_detection -n <model_path> -i <input_image_path> -l <label_file_path> -b <batch_size>
    ```
The output results will be saved under a folder named `output`, or in the directory specified by `--output-dir`.


Arguments
---------

- `-n, --net`: 
    - A **model name** (e.g., `yolov8n`) → the script will automatically download and resolve the correct HEF for your device.
    - A **file path** to a local HEF → the script will use the specified network directly.
- `-i, --input`:
  - An **input source** such as an image (`bus.jpg`), a video (`video.mp4`), a directory of images, or `camera` to use the system camera.
  - A **predefined input name** from `inputs.json` (e.g., `bus`, `street`).
    - If you choose a predefined name, the input will be **automatically downloaded** if it doesn't already exist.
- `-b, --batch_size`: [optional] Number of images in one batch. Defaults to 1.
- `-l, --labels`: [optional] Path to a text file containing class labels. If not provided, default COCO labels are used.
- `-s, --save_stream_output`: [optional] Save the output of the inference from a stream.
- `-o, --output-dir`: [optional] Directory where output images/videos will be saved.
- `-r, --resolution`: [Camera input only] Choose output resolution: `sd` (640x480), `hd` (1280x720), or `fhd` (1920x1080). If not specified, native camera resolution is used.
- `--show-fps`: [optional] Display FPS performance metrics for video/camera input.

```shell script
./oriented_object_detection.py -h

Visualization Configuration
-------------------------------------------
The application supports flexible configuration for how detections results are visualized. These settings can be modified in the configuration file to adjust the appearance of detection outputs.

#### Example Configuration:
```json

  "visualization_params": {
    "score_th": 0.35,
    "max_boxes_to_draw": 500
  },

Additional Notes
----------------

- The example was only tested with ``HailoRT v4.23.0``
- The example expects a HEF which maps to the same outputs in the configuration json.
- Images are only supported in the following formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .bmp
- Number of input images should be divisible by batch_size
- For any issues, open a post on the [Hailo Community](https://community.hailo.ai)

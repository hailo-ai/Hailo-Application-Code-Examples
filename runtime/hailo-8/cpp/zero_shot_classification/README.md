CLIP Zero-shot Classification
=============================

This example performs zero-shot classification using a Hailo8 device, allowing you to input an image and multiple text prompts to generate classification probabilities. The example receives HEF files for the text and image encoders, tokenized prompts, and an optional frame count, then outputs the most likely prompt for each input frame.

Requirements
------------

- `hailo_platform` >= 4.19.0
- `OpenCV` >= 4.2.X
- `CMake` >= 3.20

Usage
-----
0. Verify Dependencies: ensure you have the correct version of HailoRT and that all dependencies are installed

1. Download resources
	```shell script
    ./download_resources.sh
    ```
    The following files will be downloaded: 
    - bus.jpg
    - clip_text_encoder_vit_l_14_laion2B.hef
    - clip_vit_l_14_laion2B_image_encoder.hef
    - text_projection.bin
    - ViT-L-14_laion2b_s32b_b82k.npy
    - bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt

    Note: Some downloaded files (e.g., text_projection.bin, ViT-L-14_laion2b_s32b_b82k.npy, and bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt) are essential even if you are using your own HEF files.

2. Compile the project
	```shell script
    ./build.sh
    ```
	This will create a build/x86 directory containing the executable file clip_async_example_cpp.

3. Run the example:

	```shell script
    ./build/x86_64/clip_async_example_cpp -te=<text-encoder-hef> -ie=<image-encoder-hef> -t=<path-to-tokenized-prompt> -i=<input-image-or-video> -n=<number-of-frames>
    ```
	
    Arguments

    - ``-te``: Path to text encoder HEF file.
    - ``-ie``: Path to image encoder HEF file.
    - ``-p``: input prompts for the text encoder.
    - ``-i``: Path to the input image for the image encoder.
    - ``-n (optional)``: Number of times to run same image.

Example Command
---------------

```shell script
./build/x86_64/clip_async_example_cpp -te=clip_text_encoder_vit_l_14_laion2B.hef -ie=clip_vit_l_14_laion2B_image_encoder.hef -p="a bird","a bus","a boat" -i=bus.jpg -n=30
```

Notes
-----
- Supported image formats: .jpg, .png, .bmp.
- Ensure no spaces between the = and the argument value in command-line parameters.
- This example has been tested specifically with clip_vit_l14.
- The -n flag is ignored for video inputs.

Pose Estimation
================


This example performs object detection using a Hailo8 device.

The example takes an input (image), performs inference using the input HEF file and draws the detection boxes, class type, confidence, keypoints and joints connection on the resized image.  
The example works with .jpg, .jpeg, .png and .bmp image files.

Requirements
------------

- hailo_platform==4.18.0
- Pillow
- loguru
- numpy
- opencv

Supported Models
----------------

This example expects the hef to contain HailoRT-Postprocess. 

Because of that, this example only supports detections models that allow hailort-postprocess:
- yolov8s



Usage
-----

0. Install PyHailoRT
    - Download the HailoRT whl from the Hailo website - make sure to select the correct Python version. 
    - Install whl:
        ```shell script
        pip install hailort-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXX-linux_x86_64.whl
        ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone <https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples.git>
        
    cd Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/runtime/python/pose_estimation
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download example files:
    ```shell script
    ./download_resources.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```shell script
    ./pose_estimation.py -n <model_path> -i <input_image_path> -b <batch_size> -cn <class_num>
    ```

Arguments
---------

- ``-n, --net``: Path to the pre-trained model file (HEF).
- ``-i, --input``: Path to the input image on which object detection will be performed.
- ``-b,`` ``--batch_size``: Number of images in one batch.
- ``-cn, --class_num``: The number of classes the model is trained on. Defaults to 1.


For more information:
```shell script
./pose_estimation.py -h
```
Example 
-------
**Command**
```shell script
./pose_estimation.py -n yolov8s_pose.hef -i zidane.jpg -b 1
```

Additional Notes
----------------

- The example was only tested with ``HailoRT v4.18.0``
- The example expects a HEF which contains the HailoRT Postprocess
- The script assumes that the image is in one of the following formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .bmp
- The annotated files will be saved in the `output_images` folder. 
- The number of input images should be divisible by the batch_size

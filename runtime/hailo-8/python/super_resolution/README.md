Super resolution 
================

This example performs super resolution using a Hailo8 device.
It receives an input image and enhances the image quality and details.

![output example](./output_example.png)

Requirements
------------

- hailo_platform==4.20.0
- Pillow
- loguru
- opencv-python

Supported Models
----------------

- real_esrgan_x2
- espcn_x4
 
Usage
-----

0. Install PyHailoRT
    - Download the HailoRT whl from the Hailo website - make sure to select the correct Python version. 
    - Install whl:
        ```shell script
        pip install hailort-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXX-linux_x86_64.whl
        ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone <https://github.com/hailo-ai/Hailo-Application-Code-Examples.git>
        
    cd Hailo-Application-Code-Examples/runtime/python/super_resolution
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download example files:
    ```shell script
    ./download_resources.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```shell script
    ./super_resolution -n <model_path> -i <input_image_path> -o <output_path> 
    ```

Arguments
---------

- ``-n, --net``: Path to the pre-trained model file (HEF).
- ``-i, --input``: Path to the input image on which super resolution will be performed.
- ``-o, --output``: Path to save the output and comparison.

For more information:
```shell script
./super_resolution.py -h
```
Example 
-------
**Command**
```shell script
./super_resolution.py -n ./real_esrgan_x2.hef -i input_image.png
```

Additional Notes
----------------

- The example was only tested with ``HailoRT v4.20.0``
- The script assumes that the image is in one of the following formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .bmp
